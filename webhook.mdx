# Overview

This page describes the webhook feature and how to set it up.

Before anything else, you need to have a URL endpoint set up to receive `POST` requests. This will be a server location you control and use to process webhook messages as they are delivered.

Each endpoint can be subscribed to specific events that occur in the Paywint platform. Most events have multiple versions, such as `initiated`, `processing`, `success`, `failed`, and `rejected`.

# Delivery & Retry Behavio

If your webhook endpoint fails to return a `2xx` HTTP response, Paywint will automatically retry delivery up to **two more times**, for a total of **three attempts** per event.

* Retries are sent within a predefined timeframe.
* If all attempts fail, Paywint will notify your account’s **admin email** with details of the failed event.

> **Tip:** Ensure your endpoint returns `200 OK` quickly. Any internal processing should happen asynchronously to avoid missed events.
