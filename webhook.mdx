## Overview

This page explains the webhook feature and how to configure it

To start receiving webhook events, you need to set up a single URL endpoint that accepts `POST` requests. This endpoint should be hosted on a server you control and able to handle the incoming webhook payloads.

All webhook events generated by the Paywint such as `initiated`, `processing`, `success`, `failed`, and `rejected`— will be sent to the configured URL.

# Delivery & Retry Behavior

If your webhook endpoint fails to return a `2xx` HTTP response, Paywint will automatically retry delivery up to **two more times**, for a total of **three attempts** per event.

* Retries are sent within a predefined timeframe.
* If all attempts fail, Paywint will notify your account’s **admin email** with details of the failed event.

> **Note:** To avoid missed events, ensure your webhook endpoint is highly available and returns `200 OK` quickly. Any internal processing should happen asynchronously to avoid missed events.
