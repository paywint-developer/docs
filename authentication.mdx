**All API requests to Paywint must be made over HTTPS and authenticated using an API key.**
Include the API key in the request header as `X-Platform-ID`, and the HMAC-SHA256 signature in `X-Signature`. [Learn how to generate signatures →](/signature-auth)

The signature should be generated using your platform's secret key and the [canonical string format](/signature-auth#canonical-string-format): `METHOD + PATH + QUERY + BODY_HASH`

```curl Example Api Call
curl -X POST "https://<environment>/api/platform/users/create" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Platform-ID: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Signature: GENERATED_SIGNATURE" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "phone_country_code": "+1"
  }'

```

Make sure to use the correct API key for the appropriate [environment](/environments). Using the wrong key or URL may result in authentication failures.

Keep your API key secure and never expose it on the client side.
